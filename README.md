# Overview

## Motivation
Assessing the condition and visibility of veins is an important step before obtaining intravenous access in the antecubital fossa. This is a common procedure to draw blood or administer intravenous therapies (IV therapies). Even though medical practitioners are highly skilled at intravenous cannulation, they usually struggle to perform the procedure in patients with low visible veins due to fluid retention, age, overweight, dark skin tone, or diabetes. Commonly, SOTA investigations propose combining Near Infrared imaging (NIR) and deep learning (DL) techniques for forearm vein segmentation. However, the more detailed the localization of veins in the antecubital fossa, the more helpful it would be in reducing the time required for venipuncture.

In view of the above, we introduce a new NIR-based forearm vein segmentation dataset of 2,016 labelled images collected from 1,008 subjects with low visible veins. Second, we propose a framework that locates veins specifically in the antecubital fossa region of a patient's arm. Additionally, a compressed version of the proposed framework is embedded inside a bespoke, portable vein finder device. 

## Proposed framework and DL architecture
The framework to extract veins in the antecubital region consists of the next steps:

The segmentation model, shown in blue, is depicted in the following figure:

Inference is performed with grayscale images of 512x512 pixels. The net obtains a mask, coordinates of the antecubital fossa, and an angle.

# Dataset

The database used for this work was built from scratch. 1,008 subjects with low-visible veins placed one arm at a time, while we captured a NIR image with the initial version of the vein finder. For more specific information about the labelling process, please refer to the paper. The final version of the dataset can be found here: [Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/191uA9ErYRSXculIa3AXHqfBhXjd7O3St/view?usp=sharing). We created an additional [Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-6hCFfxxFFCx1fuBaQODVqDVOiWPl42U/view?usp=sharing) version with normalized samples of 512x512 dimensions for immediate training with the proposed notebooks in the repository.
